# Your Test Task:

### Build a simple web application with Next.js. Use Tailwind CSS for the design.

### The app should display a list of items from a mock JSON file. This shows how you handle data.

### Make sure the design works well on both phones and computers.

### Add a couple of pages to the app and set up navigation between them.
